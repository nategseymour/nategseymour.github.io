	<h1>Pasta della Testa</h1>
	<p>
<strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
24oz (or more) fresh tomatoes<br>
6 (or more) cloves garlic<br>
1 box high quality pasta<br>
1 block tasty cheese (or cheese equivalent)<br>
1 handful fresh basil, chopped<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
Get a bunch of good tomatoes--the multicolor cherry ones work great, but fresh off the vine is good too--or a mix! Cut them all into 1 or ½-inch pieces and toss in a bowl with a splash of olive oil and a little bit of salt.<br>
<br>
Pop open a handful of garlic cloves and peel. Cut the buttholes off but leave whole otherwise.<br>
<br>
Bring a large pot of well-salted water to boil (taste the water to be sure it’s salted enough)<br>
<br>
Heat a deep, tall-sided pan or crock pot. Add 1/4 inch olive oil and wait a moment until oil is shimmering hot but not quite smoking. Toss garlic in and fry until the garlic is fragrant and golden brown. Quickly remove and reserve garlic using a fork or tongs, leaving the oil in the pot.<br>
<br>
Add the tomatoes to the garlic-infused oil and stir gently. Cook tomatoes down (stirring occasionally) until a sauce begins to form. Crush any larger chunks with a wooden spoon if needed. This will take at least 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, once cooled, mince the fried garlic and save for later.<br>
<br>
Also meanwhile, cook pasta in the large pot until nearly al dente (it’ll cook a little bit more in the sauce). Reserve 1 cup of pasta water. Drain pasta, do not rinse.<br>
<br>
Once the tomato mixture is nice and thicc, stir the minced garlic back into the pot. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce pot and gently toss with tongs. Add a splash of reserved pasta water if everything is getting too dense.<br>
<br>
<strong>BOOM.</strong> Now you have a delicious pasta dish. Add cheese (or equivalent) and basil and serve.<br>
<br>
This is a flexible one and is easy to iterate upon depending on what you have on hand. I like to use a separate pan to cook up some sliced mushrooms and onions and add them to the sauce once it’s in the thickening stage. You can also brown some impossible/beyond beef on the side and add to the sauce. Diced black olives and capers will give it a puttanesca vibe. Etc etc have fun.<br>
