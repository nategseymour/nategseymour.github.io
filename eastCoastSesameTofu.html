	<h1>East Coast Fried Sesame Tofu</h1>
	<p>
<strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
1 package extra firm tofu<br>
1/3 cup oyster or hoisin sauce<br>
1 tbsp Shaoxing wine (I can never find this but sherry or dry white wine works too)<br>
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil<br>
vegetable oil<br>
2 large eggs<br>
1 cup corn starch<br>
1 3/4 tsp kosher salt<br>
5 cloves garlic, chopped<br>
5 tsp tomato paste<br>
1/4 lightly packed brown sugar<br>
3 tbsp rice vinegar<br>
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper<br>
2 tsp toasted sesame seeds *<br>
4 cups steamed rice<br>
4 cups steamed broccoli<br>
<br>
* Can't find toasted sesame seeds at the store? No problem, heat a dry pan until nearly smoking, then add regular sesame seeds and shake constantly over high heat until the seeds turn golden brown and smell fragrant and nutty. Transfer to a bowl for later use.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
Slice tofu into 1/2 inch x 1 inch rectangles. Lay flat on a cutting board, wrap with paper towels, and place something heavy on top. Press liquid out for a few minutes until somewhat dry.<br>
<br>
In a medium bowl, add tofu, 2 tbsp of oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Mix until well combined and let marinate for 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat 1 inch of vegetable oil over medium-high to 375 degrees (until shimmering but not smoking).<br>
<br>
Beat eggs in a wide, shallow dish. Add cornstarch to a second shallow dish. Place some of the tofu in the egg mixture and toss until fully coated, allowing excess to drip back onto the dish. Transfer tofu to the cornstarch; toss until each piece is fully coated.<br>
<br>
Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the tofu to the oil; fry until golden brown. Remove to a large paper towel-lined plate and season with 1½ tsp salt. Repeat with remaining tofu. (The oil should return to hot before frying the new batch).<br>
<br>
In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, combine 2 tbsp vegetable oil and the garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is golden brown.<br>
<br>
Add the tomato paste and fry, stirring often, until the oil is stained and the tomato paste becomes a shade darker.<br>
<br>
Stir in 3 tbsp water, the brown sugar, vinegar, the remaining 3 tbsp oyster sauce, the remaining 2 tsp sesame oil, crushed red pepper and ¾ tsp salt. Increase heat to medium and cook until the mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon.<br>
<br>
Remove the paper towel from the bowl of fried tofu and pour the sauce all over. Toss until the chicken is well coated. Transfer to a plate and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. Serve with steamed rice and broccoli, if desired.<br>
