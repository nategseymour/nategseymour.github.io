	<h1>Cold Sesame Noodles</h1>
	<p>
<strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
1 package udon or other Asian noodles<br>
2 tbsp sesame oil<br>
3 ½ tbsp soy sauce<br>
2 tbsp rice vinegar<br>
2 tbsp sesame paste *<br>
1 tbsp peanut butter<br>
1 tbsp granulated sugar<br>
1 tbsp grated ginger<br>
2 tbsp minced garlic<br>
2 tbsp chili-garlic paste, chili crisp, or chili oil (to taste) **<br>
½ cucumber, peeled and cut into matchsticks<br>
¼ cup chopped roasted peanuts<br>
<br>
* Can't find sesame paste at the store? Try putting equal parts sesame seeds and olive oil into a food processor and blend until smooth. You can also use either tahini or miso paste, but taste as you go and add a little more peanut butter if needed to balance the flavor out.<br>
<br>
** Making your own chili oil is fun! Heat some neutral oil in a pan, throw in a couple tsp of chili flakes and a few cloves of minced garlic. Once the garlic is golden brown (after a minute or so), pour the mixture over some super-thinly sliced or diced scallions in a heat-proof bowl. Allow the hot oil to cook the scallions and there you have it!<br>

<br>
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook until barely tender, about 5 minutes. They should retain a bit of chewiness.<br>
<br>
Drain noodles, rinse with cold water, drain again and toss with a splash of sesame oil.<br>
<br>
In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons sesame oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame paste, peanut butter, sugar, ginger, garlic and chile-garlic paste.<br>
<br>
Pour the sauce over the noodles and toss.<br>
<br>
Transfer to a serving bowl, and garnish with cucumber and peanuts.<br>
<br>
This dish is insanely good cold, so if you have the time it's worth refrigerating and serving later.
