	<h1>Le Plowl</h1>
	<p>
<strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
grocery store rotisserie chicken<br>
mayonnaise<br>
sriracha sauce<br>
hearty grains (such as brown rice, wild rice, or quinoa), cooked<br>
semi-hard cheese (such as gruyère or swiss), cubed<br>
leafy greens (such as arugula, spring mix, or baby spinach)<br>
crusty bread, torn into crouton-sized chunks<br>
<a href="/recipes/goodSpice.html">Good Spice</a><br>
olive oil<br>
red wine vinegar<br>
cherry tomatoes, halved<br>
avocado, cubed<br>
coarse kosher salt<br>
black pepper<br>
<br>
This is a super flexible weeknight dish! Based on the Le Bowl from Zinqué in LA's Venice neighborhood but very open to interpretation. Basically start with a base of cooked grains, add a layer of leafy greens, then a layer of dressed chicken, and then top with pickled tomatoes, cubed cheese, and homemade croutons.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
Preheat the oven to 450˚<br>
Cook your grains per usual. Brown rice takes a while so good to start now so it's ready later.<br>
Toss the bread chunks in olive oil until coated but not soggy. Sprinkle a few pinches of kosher salt and then season well with <a href="/recipes/goodSpice.html">Good Spice</a><br> until the color looks nice. These should taste pretty good even before baking.<br>
Place the seasoned bread chunks on a parchment-paper lined baking sheet in a single layer and toast in the oven until crispy and browned. About 20-30 minutes, but check and toss every ten minutes or so to prevent burning.<br>
While the croutons toast, add the halved cherry tomatoes to a bowl and cover with red wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cover with plastic and set aside, stirring occasionally.<br>
Next, tear the chicken into bite-sized pieces by hand and place the pieces in a large bowl.<br>
In a small bowl, add two large spoonfuls of mayonnaise and a squeeze of sriracha sauce. Stir together until you get a light pink color. Taste and adjust ratios to taste so it's not too mayo-y and not too spicy. Thin with water, 1 tsp at a time, until it reaches a drizzling consistency.<br>
Add the spicy mayo to the chicken and toss until evenly coated and cover and set aside.<br>
Make another batch of the spicy mayo but this time thin it with some of the vinegar from the tomatoes instead of water. You can go a bit thinner this time so it can be used as dressing on top of the bowl. If you want less mayonaise in this recipe, you can also make a mix of the tomato vinegar and some olive oil, with salt and pepper to taste.<br>
Grab a wide, shallow bowl (a plowl!) and build your layers: grains, greens, and chicken. Then top with cheese, tomatoes, and croutons.<br>
Enjoy!
