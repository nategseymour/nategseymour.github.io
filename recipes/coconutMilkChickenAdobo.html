	<h1>Coconut Milk Chicken Adobo</h1>
	<p>
<strong>Ingredients</strong><br>

2 tbsp coconut oil<br>
Cloves from one bulb of garlic (about 15) - trimmed but whole<br>
4 tsp black peppercorns<br>
2 tsp ground black pepper<br>
½ tsp red pepper flakes<br>
4 lbs bone-in, skin-on drumsticks and thighs OR 2.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast<br>
1 can unsweetened coconut milk<br>
1 cup coconut vinegar<br>
1 cup soy sauce<br>
10 bay leaves<br>
Cooked rice, for serving<br>

In a large dutch oven, heat the coconut oil over medium-high until shimmering but not smoking. Add the whole garlic cloves, peppercorns, ground pepper, and red pepper flakes, and drop the temperature to medium-low and cook about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is golden and softened and the mixture is fragrant. Using a slotted spoon, remove everything except the oil and set aside for later.<br>
<br>
Add the chicken (in batches if necessary and skin side down if using thighs and drumsticks), and cook for about 5 minutes over medium-high heat until fat starts to render and skin is golden brown. Remove chicken from heat as it becomes ready, leaving as much liquid in the pot as possible.<br>
<br>
Add the coconut milk, coconut vinegar, soy sauce, bay leaves, and 1 cup water and let the mixture come to a boil, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat to medium-low and add the chicken and garlic/pepper mixture back in and stir to combine. Simmer for about 1 hour, until the chicken feels loosened and tender.<br>
<br>
Increase the temperature to medium-high and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened to a velvety gravy. Serve chicken and sauce over rice.
